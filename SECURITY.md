# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Each release is fully supported for six months from its initial stable release. During this period, bugs and security issues that have been reported are fixed and are released in regular point releases.

After this six months period of active support, each release is then supported for an additional week for critical security issues only. Releases during this period are made on an as-needed basis: there may be multiple point releases, or none, depending on the number of reports.

Once the six months and one week of support are completed, the release reaches its end of life and is no longer supported. A table of end of life is available.
