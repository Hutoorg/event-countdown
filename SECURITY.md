# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Each release is fully supported for six months from its initial stable release. During this period, bugs and security issues that have been reported are fixed and are released in regular point releases.

After this six months period of active support, each branch is then supported for an additional weeks for critical security issues only. Releases during this period are made on an as-needed basis: there may be multiple point releases, or none, depending on the number of reports.

Once the three years of support are completed, the branch reaches its end of life and is no longer supported. A table of end of life branches is available.
